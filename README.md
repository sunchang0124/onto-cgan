**Abstract**: This repository presents a novel generative framework (Onto-CGAN) that combines knowledge drawn from disease ontologies, with conditional GAN models to generate unseen data for diseases not present in the training data. Our pre-print publication: [Generating Unseen Diseases Patient Data Using Ontology-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5043150/v1).
